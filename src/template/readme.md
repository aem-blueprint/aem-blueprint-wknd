# Note!
The Policies.json file included here is automatically generated by the site template build and is required to prevent styles being purged.
The file can be updated by running `npm run update` or `npm run update:production` with a properly configured .env file with your credentials.
Then the latest style system policies can be pulled from your local or cloud environment.
